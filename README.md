# React-Native-Expo-WatermelonDB-Demo-

## ðŸš€ How to run the App?

```bash
npx expo install or npm install

npx expo run:android  # Make sure you have Android SDKs and other required things installed for Android
# or
npx expo run:ios  # Make sure you have XCode and other required things installed for iOS

npx expo start
```

## âš  Note

-   You cannot use this with Expo go but you can try to use expo-dev-client for the developemt.
-   You will see some warnings and errors in console, because not all functions were updated as new Watermelon DB version.
-   If you resolve these issues then feel free to open a pull request to update this repo.
